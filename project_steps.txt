1) will perform basic feature enerinerging(converting varibkes into numercials,standardization)
2) make a ann by input layers=number of coloumbs in dataset(by doing dropout,loss,optimizer)
3)converting this model trained to .pickle file or .h5 file to deploy in streamlit


in ann:-
in tensorflow  ann is called sequential model/network 
the parameters in this squential model are the total number of weights and baisis used in the model
the  nurrons in hideen layers are created by keras library called dense 
activation function 
optimizer used to update weights
loss function
metrics used = in classfcation problem accuracy used ,in regression problem mse,mae ,etc used
store the training info in tensorflow to display the logs in humanly readable way/histprgrams(visualization)
